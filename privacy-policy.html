    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: May 11, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Pi Emergency Transfer ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application within the Pi Browser ecosystem.</p>
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Our application is designed with your privacy in mind. We explicitly do not collect or store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Pi Wallet passphrase or private keys</li>
        <li>Your personal identification information</li>
        <li>Your device information</li>
        <li>Your browsing history</li>
        <li>Your Pi Network account details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application runs entirely client-side in your browser and does not send your sensitive information to any server.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The application may use your browser's local storage to save application preferences and settings, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UI configuration preferences</li>
        <li>Transaction speed settings</li>
        <li>Fee rate preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Blockchain Interactions</h2>
    <p>Our application interacts directly with the Pi Network blockchain through the Pi Network API. All blockchain transactions are public by nature and are recorded on the Pi Network blockchain, which is not controlled by us.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our application may use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pi Network API (to interact with the Pi blockchain)</li>
        <li>Stellar Horizon API (for blockchain information)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies, and we recommend you review them.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data. Since our application runs entirely in your browser, your sensitive information (like wallet passphrase) never leaves your device during normal operation.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our application is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
